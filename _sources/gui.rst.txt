Graphical user interface
========================

This tool to provide the possibility to perform the tree search on a single compound using a GUI
through a Jupyter notebook. If you are unfamiliar with notebooks, you find some introduction `here <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html>`_.

To bring up the notebook, use 

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter notebook

and browse to an existing notebook or create a new one.

Add these lines to the first cell in the notebook.

.. code-block::

    from aizynthfinder.interfaces import AiZynthApp
    app = AiZynthApp("/path/to/configfile.yaml")

where the ``AiZynthApp`` class needs to be instantiated with the path to a configuration file (see :doc:`here <configuration>`).

To use the interface, follow these steps:

1. Executed the code in the cell (press ``Ctrl+Enter``) and a simple GUI will appear
2. Enter the target SMILES and select stocks and policy model. 
3. Press the ``Run Search`` button to perform the tree search.

4. Press the ``Show Reactions`` to see the top-ranked routes

You can also choose to select and sort the top-ranked routes based on another scoring function.


Creating the notebook
---------------------

It is possible to create a notebook automatically with the ``aizynthapp`` tool

.. code-block:: bash

    aizynthapp --config config_local.yml

which will also automatically opens up the created notebook.

Analysing the results
---------------------

When the tree search has been finished. One can continue exploring the tree and extract output. 
This is done by using the ``finder`` property of the app object. The finder holds a reference to an ``AiZynthFinder`` object.

.. code-block::

    finder = app.finder
    stats = finder.extract_statistics()


Clustering
-----------

There is a GUI extension to perform clustering of the routes. Enter the following a new cell 

.. code-block::

    %matplotlib inline
    from aizynthfinder.interfaces.gui.clustering import ClusteringGui
    ClusteringGui.from_app(app)


A GUI like this will be shown, where you see the hierarchy of the routes and then can select how many
clusters you want to create.
