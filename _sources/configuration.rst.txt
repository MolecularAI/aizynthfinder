Configuration file
===================

The configuration file that is to be provided to the interfaces
specify file paths to policy models and stocks, in addition to
detailed parameters of the tree search.

Simple usage
------------

Let's say you have a

    * A trained Keras expansion model that is called `uspto_expansion.onnx`
    * A library of unique templates called `uspto_templates.csv.gz`
    * A stock file in HDF5 format, called `zinc_stock.hdf5`

(this could have been created by the ``smiles2stock`` tool, see :doc:`here <stocks>`)

then to use them in the tree search, create a file called `config.yml` that has the following content

.. code-block:: yaml

    expansion:
      full:
        - uspto_expansion.onnx
        - uspto_templates.csv.gz
    stock:
      zinc: zinc_stock.hdf5


Advanced usage

A more detailed configuration file is shown below

    filter:
      uspto:
        type: quick-filter
        model: /path/to/keras/model/weights.hdf5
        exclude_from_policy: rc
        filter_cutoff: 0.05
        use_remote_models: False

      buyables:
        type: inchiset
        path: /path/to/stock1.hdf5
      emolecules: /path/to/stock1.hdf5

The (expansion) policy models are specified using two files
    * a checkpoint files from Keras in ONNX or hdf5 format,
    * a HDF5 or a CSV file containing templates.

A key like ``my_policy`` should be set and the configuration contains ``type``, ``model`` and ``template`` that must be provided. 
If the other settings are not assigned, their default values are taken. 
The policy ``my_full_policy`` exemplifies a short-cut to the template-based expansion model when no other settings need to be 
provided, only the ``model`` and ``templates`` can be provided. The default settings will be taken in this case.

The template file should be readable by ``pandas`` using  the ``table`` key and the ``retro_template`` column.
A policy can then be selected using the provided key, like ``my_policy`` in the above example.

The filter policy model is specified using a single checkpoint file.
Any key like ``uspto`` can be set. The settings contains ``type`` and ``model`` that must be provided. If the other
settings are not assigned, their default values are taken. 
The filter ``uspto_full`` exemplifies a short-cut to the quick-filter model when no other settings need to be 
provided, only the ``model`` can be provided. The default settings will be taken in this case.


The stock files can be
     * HDF5 files with the ``table`` key an the ``inchi_key`` column.
     * A CSV file with a ``inchi_key`` column
     * A text file a single column

In all cases, the column should contain pre-computed inchi keys of the molecules.
The stocks can be set using any key, like ``buyables`` or ``emolecules`` in the above example.
The ``type`` and ``path`` parameters can also be set along with other parameters.
If no other settings need to be provided, only the ``path`` can be provided, whereby it will be 
treated as a 
short-cut to the inchiset class..

The values in the ``search`` sections are optional, and if missing, default values are considered. These
values can also be taken from environment variables. An example of this can be seen as below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    search:
      iteration_limit: ${ITERATION_LIMIT}
      algorithm_config:
        C: ${C}
      time_limit: ${TIME_LIMIT}
      max_transforms: ${MAX_TRANSFORMS}

These are the available ``search`` settings. The ``algorithm_config`` refers to MCTS settings:
